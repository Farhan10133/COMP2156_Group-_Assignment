Software development and IT operations are combined in a set of processes called DevOps, which enables businesses to provide applications and services more quickly, more reliably, and with higher-quality code.
The goal of DevOps is to streamline the software development and deployment process, reduce errors and risks, and improve collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.
Continuous delivery (CD), which involves automatically releasing changes to production as soon as they are ready, and continuous integration (CI), which entails routinely merging code changes into a shared repository and testing them, are two key DevOps approaches. Infrastructure as code (IAC), which involves managing infrastructure using the same version control tools used for application code, and monitoring and logging, which entail gathering information on application performance and using it to quickly identify and address issues, are additional crucial components of DevOps.
